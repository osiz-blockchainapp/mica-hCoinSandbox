Micash
=====

The Project
-----------

Micash is a distributed consensus platform with meta-consensus
capability. Tezos not only comes to consensus about the state of its ledger,
like Bitcoin or Ethereum. It also attempts to come to consensus about how the
protocol and the nodes should adapt and upgrade.

 - Developer documentation is available online at http://tezos.gitlab.io/master
   always in sync with the master branch (which may be desynchronized with
   the code running on the live networks, replace `master` in the URL by the
   branch of your choice: mainnet, alphanet, zeronet, to make sure you are
   consulting the right API version)
 - The website https://tezos.com/ contains more information about the project.
 - All development happens on GitLab at https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos
